This project applies machine learning to predict property insurance premiums, with XGBoost and LightGBM emerging as the top-performing models. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ², these models demonstrated strong accuracy in premium prediction. The results highlight how insurers can leverage machine learning to refine risk assessment, optimize pricing strategies, and offer fair coverage to homeowners.
